# Introduction #

The tuner is the user interface so it's pretty important, but also pretty hard to do prior to knowing exactly how the firmware and hardware are going to work exactly.

The plan is to do the tuner in 2 steps.

Step 1 will be a re-work of an existing open source tuner to get something that at least does the basics up quickly to allow the project to proceed to on engine testing.


Step 2 will be to refine the tuner.  This might mean several things ranging from partnering with a commercial tuner software company, doing additional rework to an existing, or writing a tuner from scratch.
