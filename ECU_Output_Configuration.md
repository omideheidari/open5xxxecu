**Enable Injector Channels** - This turns on/off all configured injector drivers.

**Injection Channel setup** - This allows each individual injection channel to be set enabled for driving fuel injectors or optional outputs.  The injectors should be connected and configure such that injector 1 is cylinder 1, injector 2 is in cylinder 2, etc.  Staged injectors should start back at cylinder 1 so on a 4 cylinder engine injector 5 would be the cylinder 1 staged injector.

**Enable Ignition Channels** - This turns on/off all configured ignition coils.

**Ignition Channel setup** - This allows each individual ignition channel to be set enabled for driving coils or optional outputs.  The ignition coils should be connected and configure such that coil 1 is cylinder 1, coil 2 is in cylinder 2, etc.
