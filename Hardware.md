# Introduction #

The CPU used is the very powerful MPC5554 from FreeScale. It uses the PowerPC instruction set and runs at 132Mhz. Some support will also be provided for the lower powered MPC5634 and the industry's fastest - the 5 core, 180 Mhz MPC5676R MCU announced by FreeScale.

The CPU board is the phyCOREÂ®-MPC5554. Some support may also be provided for other boards.

The I/O board with injector drivers, ignition coil drivers, power regulation, etc, etc will be available soon. Current schematic is available at:

# Design concepts and theories #
Here are a couple links that detail some of the reasons why certain components where selected, and what we expect for their characteristics as a system.
  * [Injector drive theory](http://code.google.com/p/open5xxxecu/wiki/Injector_driver_theory) OVP MOSFET's are good, other are less optimal, this attempts to explain why.
  * [Analog / GPIO protection theory](http://code.google.com/p/open5xxxecu/wiki/AN_and_DIGI_Protection) This predicts our protections against direct rail shorts, and low pass filtering.
