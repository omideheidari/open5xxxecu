Taking you time to plan the project will save you a lot of time and money and let you do the best job possible controlling you engine so it’s not a step you want to skip and take lightly.

The first step in planning it to read and understand this manual.  The manual explains how everything works, how it interacts with everything else and how it needs to be connected and configure to work properly.

A good project plan should list:
  1. ll the sensors or inputs you need to the ECU
  1. ll the outputs you need from the ECU
  1. ll the components you already have and want to re-use
  1. ll the components you need to buy (don’t forget wire, connectors, loom cover, ect)
  1. here you plan to mount the components
  1. simulation or other estimate of the engine’s output. (the better you understand the engine you are building the better you will be able to control it)

Not all things you plan to implement will need to be done at the same time so another good plan item on big projects is to break it down to “phases” that start with getting the engine running then add the optional tasks.  For example setting up traction control is not particularly important if the engine doesn’t run but making sure a Drive By Wire throttle is working properly should happen before you try to start the engine.
